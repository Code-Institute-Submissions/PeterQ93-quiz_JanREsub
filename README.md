- #f3f3f3 for the letter on the choices.
- rgb(32, 32, 32) for the background of the letter choice.

All colours have been implemented to compliment each other and be aesthetically pleasing. I tried to keep to a theme of using #f3f3f3 and rgb(32, 32, 32).
 
## **Typography**

- I kept it simple and consistent with one text Inconsolata. Its applied throughout all my pages and is nice and easy to read.

- First one you can save your name and score but to save the data you first have to enter your name or you cannot press the button.
- Once saved you should get a sweet alert telling you your score has been saved.

Testing functionality

 - I tested all the buttons worked correctly by pressing each one and making sure they returned the correct outcome.
 - I tested the quiz itself by selecting each answer and making sure i was getting the correct outcome e.g the correct answer returned it correct and returned the sweet alert with adding 10 points for the correct answer.
 - I also made sure once you selected the wrong answer that you got the correct sweet alert and no bonus was added for that.
 - I also checked that by clicking the buttons numerous times that we still go the right outcome and the app did not break.
 - I made sure that at the end of the game you could save the users score and that before they submit there score they had to enter a name.
 - I also tested the highscores page to make sure what i was submitting was returning the correct data to local storage.
 - I checked that all links open into a new tab and they brought me to the correct site.


## **Bugs**

Questions

 - Sometimes the api would generate a question and there would be still some html code in the question.
 - To fix this i realised i had .innerText in the javascript so i changed it to .innerHTML and that fixed the bug.

Loader 

 - When i put the loader into the site it would load but would not go away.
 - To fix this i realised i had my id in the wrong place and i had my add and hide loader in a seperate function so i moved them to start game function and it fixed this.

Highscore

 - Once i saved the users highscores it would return undefined.
 - To fix this i seen in the endgame.js i had score.innerHTML and once i removed innerHTML it returned the correct score.

Sweet Alert

 - I tried to add a sweet alert i found on google and once i put the code into javascript and css it would not show up.
 - To fix this i found another one which you put a script tag into your html file and it fixed this.

Responsiveness 

 - Whenever i viewed the site in dev tools the responsiveness was not right as it got smaller.
 - To fix this i inserted most my content on each html page into 3 divs all with the same css code to keep it all in line.
